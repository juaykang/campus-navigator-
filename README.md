Campus Navigator is a web application that helps users find the shortest path between two locations on a campus. By entering a starting location and a destination, users can visualize the optimal route they should take to get from one place to another. The application uses Java for the backend logic, with HTML and CSS for the frontend user interface.

Features

Shortest Path Calculation: Users can enter their starting location and destination, and the system calculates the shortest path between the two points.
Interactive UI: A simple and easy-to-use interface to input locations and view results.
Campus Map: Visual representation of the campus (optional feature, can be added for better user experience).
Optimized Routes: The algorithm finds the most efficient route based on the data provided.
Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Java (for the algorithm and server-side logic)
Algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm (or another shortest path algorithm, depending on your implementation)

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Java (JDK 8 or above)
Web Browser (for testing the UI)

Acknowledgements

Java for backend logic.
HTML and CSS for the user interface.
Dijkstra's algorithm (or your chosen algorithm) for pathfinding.
